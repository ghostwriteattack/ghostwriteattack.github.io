{{< title title="RISC-V." subtitle="A New CPU Architecture.">}}

A CPU's behavior is defined by an instruction set architecture (ISA), which specifies the valid assembly instructions. 
If two CPUs follow the same ISA, they can run the same programs.

Today, the CPU market is mostly dominated by two ISA specifications: x86 and ARM. 
These are controlled by a few companies, which limits how freely other companies can design their products. 
Using or modifying these ISAs requires expensive licenses and is restricted to a selected group of partners.

[RISC-V](https://riscv.org/) is a new, open ISA that anyone can use and contribute to without restrictions. 
This openness has led to a thriving ecosystem, with continuous software improvements and new RISC-V-based hardware frequently emerging. 
You can even find RISC-V-based bare-metal servers [in the cloud](https://labs.scaleway.com/en/em-rv1/).
