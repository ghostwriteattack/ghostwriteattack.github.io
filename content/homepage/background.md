{{< title title="Fundamentals." subtitle="Process Isolation and Assembly Instructions.">}}

Modern operating systems work together with the CPU to keep each process running on your system isolated from the others. 
To do this, the operating system divides the *physical* memory into separate *virtual* memory spaces, one for each process. 
This ensures that each process can only access its own *virtual* memory and cannot interfere with other processes.

Your computer runs programs by executing instructions on the CPU. 
These instructions can range from very simple tasks, such as adding two numbers, to more complex operations. 
Usually, these instructions and their behaviors are thoroughly documented in the CPU vendor's manuals. 
However, CPUs sometimes also contain undocumented instructions.
